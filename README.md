# ORLIAn Source Code
Broken into 4 sections: 
1) Data Preperation
2) Model Construction
3) Visualizer using GradCam
4) Wiki (see tabs)

## How to use 
Models were run and implemented on Google Colab using a GPU (CUDA)
Untested on other hardware

1. Run the Data_Preperation notebook. Make sure your filepaths are correct
2. Once data preperation is done, run the MODEL_PATH notebook. Remember to set your models paths right
3. Outputted model should appear wherever you set MODEL_PATH in the Run_Model notebook
4. Run Generate_Visualizations_Using_GradCam to get your visualizations if you are debugging

## Running this code
Please use Google Colab with a GPU accelerator to ensure best performance. 
Untested on everything else, especially M1 Macs
